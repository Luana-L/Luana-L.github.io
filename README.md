# SSTP

Hello!

This repo contains the code I worked on in the summer of my junior year of high school for a summer program during 2021. 
Please check out the research brief pdf for more on what this code intended to achieve! The website is viewable here: https://luana-l.github.io/

The project is not fully functioning due to the time constraints and inability to integrate the simulation elements that one of my colleagues worked on,
but the GUI that I developed is included in this repo.
